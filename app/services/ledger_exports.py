"""Spreadsheet and printable exports of the core ledger reports (#179).

One layout per report, the same columns as the screen, with a short
preamble (company, report, period) so a file saved from one company can be
read without the program — and, later, fed to group reporting (#180), which
reads one trial balance per company. The preamble is always four lines
(three labelled rows and a blank) so a reader can skip it by count.

Amounts are written with two decimals and no currency sign or thousands
separator, so a spreadsheet reads them as numbers.
